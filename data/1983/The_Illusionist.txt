Title: The Illusionist
Author: Anita Mason
Published By: Holt Rhinehart & Winston
This is a novel about Simon Magus who was a Samaritan magus or religious figure and a convert to Christianity, baptised by Philip, whose later confrontation with Peter is recorded in Acts 8:9-24. In apocryphal works including the Acts of Peter, Pseudo-Clementines, and the Epistle of the Apostles, Simon also appears as a formidable sorcerer with the ability to levitate and fly at will.
Ms. Mason weaves the story of this extraordinary man around the turbulent ambience of the time. She demonstrates how during Jesus' own lifetime and later there were various miracle makers abroad, attracting great audiences with their shows. Simon Magus, a man of no religion, bisexual and with a penchant for young boys, mixes with the early Christians including Peter, not on enemy terms, but perfectly civilly. He travels around making great illusions for all to see, but always remains essentially a man.
