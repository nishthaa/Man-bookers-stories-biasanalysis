Title: Shame
Author: Salman Rushdie
Published By: Vintage
In this dazzling tale of an ongoing duel between the families of two men – one a celebrated wager of war, the other a debauched lover of pleasure – Rushdie brilliantly portrays a world caught between honor and humiliation – “shamelessness, shame: the roots of violence.” Shame is an astonishing story that grows more timely by the day.
