Set in San Fernando Valley and Hungary in 1997, the story revolves around a late-stage cancer patient, Alice; her two markedly different sons, one a translator, the other a soap star; and a seemingly unconnected Hungarian playwright named L치szl칩 L치z치r. The plot centres on the family's troubles and the sons coming to terms with the fact that their mother will likely not see another birthday.
