Title: The Lost Father
Author: Marina Warner
Published By:
According to family legend, David Pittagors died as a result of a duel. His death is the mysterious pivot around which his grand-daughter, an independent modern woman, constructs an imaginary memoir of her motherâ€™s background and life. She follows the family as they emigrate to New York - where they find only humiliation and poverty - and after their return to Italy in the 1920s. As she is drawn by the passions and prejudices of her imagination, we see how family memory, like folk memory, weaves its own dreams.
