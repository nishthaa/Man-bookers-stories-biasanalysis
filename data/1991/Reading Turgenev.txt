Title: Reading Turgenev
Author: William Trevor

Mary Louise Dallon, fearful of being trapped forever in her parents' cramped farmhouse, is too naive to resist the limited attractions of the nearby small town in the provincial Ireland of 1955. A hasty marriage leads to despair and desolation. Read by the actress Sinead Cussack.
