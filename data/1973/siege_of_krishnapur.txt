Title: The Siege of Krishnapur
Author: J.G. Farrell
Published By: New York Review of Books
India, 1857 -- the year of the Great Mutiny, when Muslim soldiers turned in bloody rebellion on their British overlords. Farrell's story is set in an isolated Victorian outpost on the subcontinent. Rumors of strife filter in from afar, and yet the members of the colonial community remain confident of their military and, above all, moral superiority. But when they find themselves under actual siege, the true character of their dominion -- at once brutal, blundering, and wistful -- is soon revealed.
