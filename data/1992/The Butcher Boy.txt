Title: The Butcher Boy
Author: Patrick McCabe
published By : Delta
"I was thinking how right ma was -- Mrs. Nugent all smiles when she met us and how are you getting on Mrs. and young Francie are you both well? What she was really saying was: Ah hello Mrs. Pig how are you and look Philip do you see what's coming now -- The Pig Family!"
This is a precisely crafted, often lyrical, portrait of the descent into madness of a young killer in small-town Ireland. "Imagine Huck Finn crossed with Charlie Starkweather," said The Washington Post.
