Schoolteacher Barbara Covett leads a solitary existence. When Sheba Hart joins St. George’s as the new art teacher, Barbara senses the possibility of a new friendship. But as Barbara and Sheba’s relationship develops, another does as well: Sheba has begun a sexual affair with an underage male pupil.
When it comes to light and Sheba falls prey to the inevitable media circus, Barbara decides to write an account in her friend’s defence - an account that reveals not only Sheba’s secrets but her own.
