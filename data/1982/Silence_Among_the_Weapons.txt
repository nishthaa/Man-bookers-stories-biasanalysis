Title: Silence Among the Weapons
Author: John Arden
Published By:
Silence Among the Weapons has a more or less ordinary central character -- an actor’s agent -- who gets caught up in more or less extraordinary events; the expansionist activities of the Republic of Rome in the first century B.C. Following his hero’s adventures across half the known world from Asia Minor to the very heart of Rome itself, Arden allows us vivid glimpses of a world in turmoil under the heel of colonial ambition and of the furious resistance that this has aroused amongst the subject peoples.
