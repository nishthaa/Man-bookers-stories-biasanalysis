Title: His Bloody Project
Author: Graeme Macrae Burnet
Published By: Contraband
In 1869, the case of Roderick Macrae gripped the British public: newspapers slavishly followed his trial, and ‘penny dreadfuls’ gleefully described the gory details of the brutal slaying of three people in a remote crofting community.
In His Bloody Project, author Graeme Macrae Burnet recounts the story of the murders and the subsequent trial.
Roderick’s memoir, along with court transcripts, medical reports, police statements and newspaper articles, show that the accused readily admitted his guilt leaving only the persuasive powers of his advocate standing between him and the gallows.
So why didn’t he defend himself more vigorously, or try to cover up the crime? Was he stupid? Insane?
Or did he have another motive?
Brought together, the documents relating to the case of Roderick Macrae reveal much about a merciless triple-murder that shocked the nation. But do they reveal just why a young man would commit the most atrocious acts of violence?
And will he hang?
