Title: Rhine Journey
Author: Ann Schlee
Published By: Penguin
It is the summer of 1851. An English family is making a romantic journey by paddle-steamer on the Rhine, and Charlotte’s imagination is stretched to the limit - one might almost say, to the breaking point.
She is the unmarried sister of the Reverend Charles Morrison with whose family she is travelling. As they board the boat, Charlotte suddenly mistakes a passenger for the man she gave up years ago, at her brother’s insistence. From that moment, this extraordinarily evocative novel creates an aura of romantic, erotic tension that is a compelling as it is mysterious. Charlotte’s interior passion is counterpointed with the stifling manners of the time, and inexorably she is drawn closer to confrontation with the passenger, and herself.
Rhine Journey has a flavor all of its own, which comes partly form Ann Schlee’s sense of period, partly from the precision of her writing, and above all rests on the character of Charlotte with her uncontrollable dreams and fantasies. Here is a supple and strikingly original novel which introduces one of the mot exciting talents to emerge for a long time.
