Title: Rising
Author: R C Hutchinson
Published By: Faber Finds
Sabino - the outcast member of a rich mine-owning family - is renowned for his arrogance and brutality. For reasons of personal revenge, he agrees to lead an expedition to crush saboteurs who are attacking a vital railway line. Leading his struggling army of half-starved men across the arid and treacherous landscape, Sabino also embarks on a journey of the soul. "Rising", first published in 1976, was R.C. Hutchinson's last novel. It is a powerful re-creation of an episode of South American history, and also a profound and poignant exploration of the complexity of human relationships, and of one man's attempt at redemption. At its heart lies the burning struggle between good and evil.
