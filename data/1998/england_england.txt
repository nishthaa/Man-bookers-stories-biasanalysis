Title: England, England
Author: Julian Barnes
Published By: Folio
As every schoolboy knows, you can fit the whole of England on the Isle of Wight. The grotesque, visionary tycoon Sir Jack Pitman takes the saying literally and does exactly that. Starting from the premise that most tourists are interested only in the top attractions and are as satisfied with a replica as with the real thing, he constructs on the island ‘The Project’, a vast heritage center containing everything ‘English’, from Buck House to Stonehenge, from Manchester United to the White Cliffs of Dover.
