Title: Headlong
Author: Michael Frayn
Published By: Faber and Faber
A novel of historical investigation and comic invention, Headlong pitches from gallery to museum to library delivering an extended lesson in iconography and aesthetics.
It uses the elusive story behind a painting, thought, by an easily-distracted philosopher, to be a lost work of Brueghel. He risks everything he has in his efforts to establish its provenance and then spirit it from its owner.
