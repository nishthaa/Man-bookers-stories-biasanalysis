Title: The Line of Beauty
Author: Alan Hollinghurst
Published By: Picador
It is the summer of 1983, and young Nick Guest has moved into an attic room in the Notting Hill home of the Feddens: Gerald, an ambitious new Tory MP, his wealthy wife Rachel, and their children.
As the boom-years of the mid-80s unfold, Nick, an innocent in matters of politics and money, becomes caught up in the Feddensâ€™ world, with its grand parties, its holidays in the Dordogne, its parade of monsters both comic and threatening. An affair with a young black clerk gives him his first experience of romance; but it is a later affair, with a beautiful millionaire, that will change his life more drastically and bring into question the larger fantasies of a ruthless decade.
The Line of Beauty was adapted into a three part television series by the BBC and aired on BBC Two in May 2006.
